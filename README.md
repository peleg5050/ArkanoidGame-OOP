Project Description
-
Arkanoid is a 1986 block breaker arcade game developed.
Controlling a paddle-like craft known as the Vaus, the player is tasked with clearing a formation of colorful blocks by deflecting a ball towards it without letting the ball leave the bottom edge of the playfield. Some blocks may be indestructible or require multiple hits to break.
In this project, I worked on several features:
I created the arachnoid game in a gradual process throughout the semester.
The game contains several stages. The difficulty level increases in higher stages.


The different screens
-
The main screen has a graphic display which runs the Arkanoid game:

### Running
To run, enter to the "ass5" folder then open cmd for this path, and in the opened terminal write:   "ant run", or in case you want to play specific game stages, you can write the desired stages and play them like this: " ant -Dargs="levelNumber" run " (for example: ant -Dargs="2 4 3" run).
A window will open, and finally the Arkanoid game will be displayed.



## Future improvements

As we continue to work on this app, we encourage anyone that wants to help out to do so!
Just open the project in Visual Studio Code and add your own touches!
Other than that, we would appreciate if you would try to stick to our design language and patterns.
